<h2>Updated Video</h2>
<p> I had some family health issues so I was not able to polish app till after due date, I broke this up into several smaller videos so you dont have to watch the camera walking around</p>

<h2>Original Video</h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VKyZDxodIqM">Video of Mobile App</a>
<p>I know the video is less then the 4 minute recommendation but my app does not have user input it is only affected by the user location/time so no error checking was included</p>
